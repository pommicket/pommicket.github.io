<h4><a href="AutoImages.html">AutoImages:</a></h4>
<p>AutoImages works by creating random functions using Markov Chains. Every image on your computer is made up of many very small squares called "pixels". Each pixel has a red, green
and blue value. If a pixel has a red of 255, a green of 0, and a blue of 0, the pixel will be red. AutoImages creates 3 functions, the red function, green function, and blue function.
Each function takes in the x and y position of each pixel (where the pixel is), and returns the red, green, or blue value for that pixel.

<div lang="latex">
\\
R(x, y) =$ the red value of the pixel at position $(x, y)\\
G(x, y) =$ the green value of the pixel at position $(x, y)\\
B(x, y) =$ the blue value of the pixel at position $(x, y)\\
$Where $R, G,$ and $B$ are created randomly.
</div>

<p>It uses the random functions to calculate the colour of each pixel in the image.</p>

<h4><a href="AutoVideos.html">AutoVideos:</a></h4>
<p>
AutoImages works by creating random functions using Markov Chains. Every video on your computer is made up of many images called "frames". When you play a video, you are just
seeing a series of images played very quickly (at 24 images per second). Each image is made up of pixels, and each pixel has a red, green, and blue value. AutoVideos' functions
given the colour of each pixel given its x and y positions, and its frame number (the first frame is frame #0, the second is frame #1 and so on).
</p>
<div lang="latex">
\\
t =$ Frame number$\\
R(x, y, t) =$ the red value of the pixel at position $(x, y)$ in frame number $t\\
G(x, y, t) =$ the green value of the pixel at position $(x, y)$ in frame number $t\\
B(x, y, t) =$ the blue value of the pixel at position $(x, y)$ in frame number $t\\
$Where $R, G,$ and $B$ are created randomly.

</div>

<h4><a href="AutoAudio.html">AutoAudio:</a></h4>
<p>
All audio is stored as a series of samples. Each sample has a y position. For example the function</p>
<div lang="latex">
\\
y(t) = sin(880 \pi t)\\
$If $t$ is the time at which the sample is played
</div>
<p>  sounds like an A
on a piano. AutoAudio creates a random function, then plays it.
</p>
<div lang="latex">
S(t) =$ the $y$ position of sample at time $t
</div>
